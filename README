I created this git for our Bot.  I have started blank in order to begin clean.  And will import aspects of
the origional bots as they are needed.  I would prefer if we were to build the basic bot first, and make
that the master, Everything beyond that can be a fork that could be integrated into the master if it proves
useful.

I would also suggest that we share this Git with the professor so he can track our use and see various iterations.

On the name: I chose Nestor from the Asimov novel "I, Robot".  Nestor is the from the story "Lost Little Robot" 
which is, to my memory, the only instance of a Asimov robot to have a flawed "First Law" and can do harm.

Thus it begins...

I don't think a robot would violate the first law by killing other robots

Scifi nerd time....

The first is to not harm or to allow harm to come to a human through action or inaction.
The second law says I robot must follow orders unless the first law would be violated.
The third is to protect its own existance unless it violates either of the first two.

Nothing in there about not hurting other robots really.  Though theoretically it could be construed as 
putting their own existance in danger by entering combat in the first place.

Anyway, I have converted the base Raven bot into Nestor_Bot and it compiles and runs
I'm working on getting it pushed properly with that smart git.  Should be seeing it tonight. We need to
talk strat this week and make our design doc.
